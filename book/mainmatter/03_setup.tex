\justify{}
Think of this chapter as the \emph{mise en place} of our DevSecOps souffle.

\justify{}
Let's start our preparations by outlining our overall objectives. We want to:

\justify{}
\begin{itemize}
	\item
	      Create an extensible lab environment for rapid prototyping and
	      development.
	\item
	      Keep our lab costs down while meeting the rest of the objectives.
	      Utilize free services and open source tools to the extent possible.
	\item
	      Use the published best practices for each tooling, operations, or
	      development ecosystem we choose to employ.
	\item
	      Always leave our projects in a functional state.
	\item
	      Get out of our old comfort zone, into a new one.
\end{itemize}

\justify{}
The ideas captured here are not a means to any particular end. Rather,
these are meant to be starting points, giving you a frame of reference
with novel technologies and techniques that will streamline your
workflows and give your projects a productivity boost. The hope is the
reader will gain momentum to pursue these new ideas by following
along with the examples outlined in this book.

\justify{}
You should work to build up a solid base of code examples and problem solving
techniques that will greatly increase your efficacy. Over time, new tools and
processes will rotate in and out of your toolbox as technology progresses. Keep
in mind that your job is to maintain that momentum, to keep experimenting and
to see what is useful enough to stick with you and make a permanent part of your
technical repertoire.

\justify{}
Companies often make their services free in the hopes that you will see the
value and usefulness of their products. The thinking goes that hopefully
you will see enough utility that you will recommend them to your
enterprise clients and integrate their products into your workflows.
Not a bad trade-off! It only makes sense to avail yourself of free-tier
cloud services, build and test platforms, and low or no-cost hosting
environments. There are plenty of these out there and we will explore
some of these as we dive further into the topics.

\justify{}
When we choose to use a tool, say Ansible\index{Ansible} for example, we must adopt the
most up-to-date and best practices for using that tool.
File system layout, naming conventions, script syntax and organization,
and so on. We get to enjoy the clear and safe path forged by the folks
that came before us, and with whom we share many goals. As your skills
mature over time, you may want to consider donating time back to the
open source and other communities upon which your knowledge has been
built.

\justify{}
Finally, I find it very helpful for my own personal peace of mind to
leave projects clean and green, to the extent possible. In other words,
there is mental benefit to tidying up your physical and virtual workspace
before walking away from the keyboard for the day. Perhaps you would
find similar benefit should you choose to adopt this practice.
\section{Prerequisites}

\justify{}
This book intends to be a practical treatment of common and popular technologies
from the DevSecOps world. As such, we assume the reader has some basic knowledge
of certain concepts. We will be exploring new ways of working for folks who
are somewhat familiar with:
\begin{itemize}
	\item
	    Linux (UI and command line)
	\item 
            Python 3
	\item
	    Familiarity with github.com and the concepts of pull requests and branching.
\end{itemize}

\justify{}
The examples in this book have been tested on Linux running the latest
version of Docker.

\justify{}
Let's take a look at some of the other foundational environmental
elements we need in place to be successful.

\section{The Workhorse (IDE)}

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\caption{The VScode IDE.}
\end{figure}

\justify{}
It is quite helpful to have a piece of software on your workstation that
makes code and document creation and edits easier. This software is
commonly known as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\index{IDE}.
A decent IDE with the right add-ons can provide syntax highlighting to show
potential issues you might have missed, help you check for spelling or
grammar mistakes in your documentation, and even makes suggestions on
alternate ways of writing your code.

\justify{}
Visual Studio Code from Microsoft is quite a popular choice these
days in a large sea of commercial and Open Source candidates.
VSCode\index{VSCode} works well on Linux, Mac and other operating systems.
The environment is easily extensible to support most any language,
linter, or syntax checker we may have a need
for, thanks to their easy to use and well integrated ``Extension''
feature. VSCode also has an integrated terminal window\index{Terminal Window}
so the developer can execute shell commands without leaving the IDE screen.

\subsection{VSCode Plugins}

\justify{}
Another extensible Open Source IDE of note is Atom.

\section{Lab Exercises}

\justify{}
This book is meant to be a workbook as much as it is meant to be read.
You are encouraged to jump ahead, go back and re-read, do the exercises
you think you can apply the learning objective from right away,
and skip the parts you don't think you will ever use. Learning can
be a non-linear experience and you
are encouraged to ``color outside the lines'' to the extent you feel
comfortable doing so.

\justify{}
That said, I've attempted to give this book a feel of moving the reader
along towards a final project.
This project is meant to guide the reader through applying the information
introduced between this chapter and that.
\section{SSH Key Setup}

\justify{}
Take a few minutes to generate an SSH key\index{SSH keys} pair if you don't already have
one. We will be using it at various stages to log in to various sites
and hosts. The directions for generating an SSH keypair found on the
github.com website are perfect for this task.

\begin{mybox}{\thetcbcounter: SSH Key Generation}
\lstinputlisting{code/03_setup/ssh-key-generation}
\end{mybox}

\justify{}
Now you can add your public key half to github.com.

\section{GPG Key Setup}

\justify{}
Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG) is a replacement for Symantec's PGP software. It allows you
to generate and asymmetric key pair that can be exchanged with other users, encrypt your
personal files, or verify your identity.

\justify{}
We will use a GPG key to sign commits
to GitHub\index{GitHub}. This will help others verify that work you check in to revision control did
actually come from you. It's not strictly necessary but is considered good practice.
Some repositories require that you sign your pull requests with your GPG key\index{GPG key}.

\justify{}
Take a few minutes to set up a GPG key. Once you have an account setup, you can add
it to your profile on GitHub.

\begin{mybox}{\thetcbcounter: GPG Key Setup}
\lstinputlisting{code/03_setup/gpg-key-setup}
\end{mybox}

\justify{}
Copy your GPG key, beginning with the string ``BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK'' and ending with the string
``END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK''. Add the GPG key to your GitHub account.
