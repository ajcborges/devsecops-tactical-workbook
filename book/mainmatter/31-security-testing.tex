This section is about things we can do to ensure we are driving out bugs and finding security issues as soon as possible in our
product lifecycle. 

\section{SAST Security Testing}

\justifying
A form of white box testing, Static Application Security Testing (SAST)\index{SAST} helps identify
shortcomings by scanning and evaluating your source code.

\section{DAST Security Testing}

\justifying
This is testing against an application that we do not have the source code to. In fact, we may not know much
about the target at all at the beginning of testing. During Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)\index{DAST}
the tester poses as an attacker to help identify gaps and vulnerabilities in the application.

\section{IAST Security Testing}

\justifying
A combination of the previous two methodologies, Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)\index{IAST} combines
SAST and DAST testing.
