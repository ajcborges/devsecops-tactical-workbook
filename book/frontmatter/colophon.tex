This book was written in the {\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredTex}{reStructuredText file format}}. The Sphinx module for Python was used to format these files and programatically generate LaTeX, and other working formats used in the typesetting process. The resultant LaTeX files were manged using TeXstudio. Some graphs have been generated programatically using the Graphviz software. The entire publishing environment is encapsulated in a container according to the principles outlined in this book.
