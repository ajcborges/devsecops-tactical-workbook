Creation is a long and twisty path, fraught with the distractions of
a life well-lived and the frenetic pace of a day and age that clamors
for a million tiny bits of our attention. A supportive and loving family
is the touchstone that grounds us through it all. The author would like
to thank his family, especially his loving wife for making it possible
to maintain focus in a focus-stealing world.
