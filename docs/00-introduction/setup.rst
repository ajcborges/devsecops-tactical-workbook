To follow along with the examples in this book you will need a host running
a recent version of Linux, or another UNIX variant. An Apple laptop
would also be a good choice. Other operating systems may work as well,
if they have the ability to run a BASH shell, install open source 
packages, etc. Support for environments other than Linux or Mac are
beyond the scope of this book.

Let's take a look at some of the foundational elements it will take to 
make us scuccessful.

The Workhorse (IDE)
-------------------

I find it extremely helpful to have an Integrated Development Environment
(IDE) that I don't have to spend a lot of time configuring. Lately that 
is Visual Studio Code for me. It works well on both Linux and Mac. The 
environment is easily extensible to support most any language, linter, or
syntax checker I might need. 

There are times I catch myself switching between VSCode and a terminal
window to do a quick edit in vi or interact with GitHub. Over time I am 
changing the way I work in an attempt to reduce attempts to refocus 
between windows on my desktop.

Work Area
---------

Take a look at the area around your keyboard and make an honest attempt 
to clear away as many distractions as possible.
