Introduction
============

At the time of this writing in 2020, about 40% of production workloads are 
running on containers and serverless deployments. This is expected to 
increase in the coming years. Bare metal and virtual machines currently host 
a bit over 60% of production workloads. Bare metal and VM usage is expected 
to decrease in the coming years [f1]_.

In this book, we will explore a combination of techniques that can refresh 
your skills and align your projects with current techniques. We can use small
bits and pieces from various technolgies to create a secure build pipeline
for our lab and development work, even production environments.
