At the time of this writing in 2020, about 40% of production workloads are 
running on containers and serverless deployments.  Bare metal and virtual machines currently host 
a bit over 60% of production workloads. Containerized workload use is expected to 
increase in the coming years. Conversely, bare metal and VM usage is expected 
to decrease[#]_. It's not a question of if, but how quickly commoditization of 
compute resources takes place, leaving only a few main providers of these resources.
This is not unlike how power generation and distribution became centralized, now
the domain of a few large utility companies. Nothing beyond considerations of 
practicality stop you from making your own electricty, but you may wish to invest
your time in other pursuits.

In this book, we will explore a combination of techniques that can refresh 
your skills and align your projects with current software development techniques. 
We can use small bits and pieces from various technolgies to create a secure build 
pipeline for our lab and development work, test, and even production environments.

We have a goal in mind of selecting complementary tools and process to construct 
and streamline our ways of working. We will attempt to leverage these ways to 
get us quickly and securely to a working lab environment. At the same time we 
should strive for simplicity and reduction of complexity whenever possible.
Complexity in our processes beome the snags and side projects that are the enemy 
of productivity. Refuse to shave more yaks than absolutely necessary!
