At the time of this writing in 2020, about 40% of production workloads are 
running on containers and serverless deployments. This is expected to 
increase in the coming years. Bare metal and virtual machines currently host 
a bit over 60% of production workloads. Bare metal and VM usage is expected 
to decrease in the coming years [#]_.

In this book, we will explore a combination of techniques that can refresh 
your skills and align your projects with current techniques. We can use small
bits and pieces from various technolgies to create a secure build pipeline
for our lab and development work, even production environments.

We have a goal in mind of selecting complementary tools and process to construct 
and streamline our ways of working. We will attempt to leverage these ways to 
get us quickly and securely to a working lab environment. At the same time we 
should strive for simplicity and reduction of complexity whenever possible.
Complexity in our processes beome the snags and side projects that are the enemy 
of productivity. Let's not shave more yaks than absolutely necessary!
