============
The Overview
============

First, you must establish what your book will be about. This means 
that you need to briefly put down the major W’s that will guide the 
rest of your proposal: the what, who, and why of your book.

Second, you need to catch the publisher’s eye. The Overview is your 
chance to make them think, Ah, finally a great proposal! So you can’t 
really just sit back and go, “The greatness of my book speaks for 
itself. Everyone will want to read about this big boy.”

Instead, it’s the “Hook” that will draw readers — which is why we 
wanted to show you a real-life example of it.
