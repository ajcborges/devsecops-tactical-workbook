A comprehensive project in a public GitHub repository that readers can follow 
along with an try examples from will be maintained.

## Market 

I've spent quite a bit of time interacting with the Information Security community on
Twitter and at many industry conferences. My first draft of this book has been written with folks from the security community in mind after talking to them about the kind of 
things they say they are interested in learning. I hear people 
say a lot that they are curious about geting started with SecDevOps concepts such 
as coding and understanding cloud technologies. I think this writing will provide a 
good "quickstart" path to accomplish exactly that. 

This book could be described as a pathway to starting out in (Sec)DevOps. Rather than a deep dive into a single topic, this book is for folks who want to get just the flavor 
of several technologies so they can develop a breadth of knowledge. This mental framework
allows people to come back and develop siloed knowledge in the technologies they need to
know the most.

My assumption is this would be a good book for folks new to the industry to follow 
along with. By this I don't just mean young or school-aged folks.
I see that there is also a need for folks who have been in the workforce 
for some years (or even decades!) to re-tool and adapt to rapidly changing 
technological landscape. 

### Competition

I realize there are many titles out there that deep dive on the individual subjects
that I cover in this book, offering a depth of knowledge in an area. 
This book would instead take a breadth of knowledge approach. 

- The [roadmap in this blog post](https://medium.com/@devfire/how-to-become-a-devops-engineer-in-six-months-or-less-366097df7737) is similar to the
idea that I am proposing.
- This [video on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkidaZmnADw) captures some of the principals I am outlining in this book.
