***************
Summary of Book
***************

Over the past five or so years I've been doing security development work, 
previously at SalesForce and now at Palo Alto Networks. 
I've developed a pattern of working that allows me to rapidly prototype 
ideas and get them through the CI/CD pipeline and into production. 

This book is me capturing that way of working as a teachable framework 
for experimentation and giving folks a way to affordably access some of the
latest and greatest technologies available today. The information it contains
is suitable for folks new to the information security, information technology, 
and software industries, as well as season professionals looking to expand 
their skillsets.

Outline

*Provide a detailed outline listing at least chapter titles and first level headings.*

I've created a github repo with Python & Sphinx that generates LaTeX and PDF
formats of a draft book.

There are also code examples in a second (already public) repository
for folks to follow along and see/try examples:

********    
Audience
********

*Who is your target audience and how will your book meet their needs?*

I've written this with folks from the security community in mind. I 
hear people say a lot that they are curious about geting started with
coding and understanding cloud technologies. I think this writing will 
provide a good "quickstart" path to accomplish exactly that. 

***********    
Competition
***********

*List any competing titles. How will your work compete?*

I realize there are many titles out there that deep dive on the subjects
that I cover in this book, offering a depth of knowledge in an area. 
This book would instead take a breadth of knowledge approach. 

******    
Market 
******

*Discuss the market for your book.*

My assumption is this would be a good book for folks new to the industry 
to follow along with. By this I don't just mean young or school-aged folks.
I see that there is also a need for folks who have been in the workforce 
for some years (or even decades!) to re-tool and adapt to rapidly changing
technological landscape.

Tech nerd, into computers since my Vic-20 days. I like spicy food 
and growing hot pepper plants, listening to music, family and dogs.

*What are your goals in writing this book?*

Ideas and personal best practices aren't much use if you can't capture
and share them. My hope is that this information will be useful and helpful
to people I will most likely be interacting with and working with in 
the future.
