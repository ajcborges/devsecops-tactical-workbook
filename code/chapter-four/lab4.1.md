# Lab 4.1 

The fork-n-clone lab.


## Forking

From the original project page on github.com, click the ``fork'' button.
This creates a copy of the original repository on your personal GitHub page.

Now from your personal GitHub repository page, make a clone of that fork from github.com to your machine.

This will allow you to add, update and test code and documentation without altering the original project.
     
## Create a Remote

On your local machine, create a ``remote'' connection back to the original repo.

Use this example command:

```sh
git remote add upstream git@github.com:devsecfranklin/devsecops-tactical-workbook.git
```

## Create a Pull Request (PR)

After completing these steps you can easily submit pull requests (PRs)
back to the original project.
